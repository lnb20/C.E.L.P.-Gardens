# C.E.L.P.-Gardens

The C.E.L.P. Gardens module aims to revolutionize the way people care for their houseplants by providing an inexpensive, autonomous solution that provides data on the environment and waters the plant without the need for human intervention.
Using a C++ algorithm loaded onto the microcontroller, the device polls for soil moisture data every 10 minutes, and if the value is below a given threshold, a pump pulling from an external reservoir is actuated, adding water to the system.
In addition, the device can be connected to an external desktop application through a micro-usb connection on the board. A python-based GUI can then be accessed, displaying sensor data and a graph of previous data polls.
The overall goal of the project is to make plant care as effortless and convenient as possible.  However, it also has the positive side effect of preventing resource waste by not over-watering.  With C.E.L.P. Gardens, anyone can have a green thumb and enjoy the benefits of a thriving indoor garden. 
The device requires a supply of 4x AA batteries, and can only be used with plant pots greater than 6 inches in diameter.
